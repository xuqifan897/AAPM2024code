According to the manuscript, there are two schemes, 15-fraction and 25-fraction. In the 15-fraction scheme, the doses for the three PTVs are 37.5, 67.5, and 90.5 Gy, respectively. In the 25-fraction scheme, however, the doses for the three PTV structures are 45, 75, and 100 Gy, respectively. So before moving forward, we have to infer which treatment scheme each patient is using.

In the 15-fraction scheme, the dose ratio of the three PTVs is 1: 1.8: 2.41.

In the 25-fraction scheme, the dose ratio of the three PTVs is 1: 1.6: 2.22

| Patient | microscopic | high dose | ultra high dose | ratio | group |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Patient001 | 27 | 49 | - | 1: 1.81: - | 15-fraction |
| Patient002 | 27 | 43 | - | 1: 1.56: - | 25-fraction |
| Patient003 | 23 | (36) | 50 | 1: (1.6) : 2.17 | 25-fraction |
| Patient004 | 23 | (36.04) | 50 | 1: (1.6): 2.27 |25-fraction |
| Patient005 | 24.90 | (44.8) | 60 | 1: (1.8): 2.41 | 15-fraction |

The table below is the normalized table

| Patient005 | 24.9 | 44.8 | 60 | 1: 1.6: 2.41 | 15-fraction |

# In practice, we use the following parameters
* Patient001
    * percentile = 85, dose = 28
    * percentile = 100, dose = 50
* Patient002
